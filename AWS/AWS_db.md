## Overview

## Different types of DB and

- relational DB vs NoSQL
- their use cases
- trade-offs among, CAP

  - consistency
  - performance
  - scalability etc

- Table 1, columns include:

  type, data model, feature, use case, AWS offered, alternatives

  (feature, alternatives can use db)

introduction to each database offered

    wiki page
    some in depth about design and architecture etc, like diagram from paper etc

    + time series


### How

for each types of db, we compare:

- definition (picture)
  - Data model
  - Feature
  - Use cases
  - Time released
  - Alternatives
- Deployment mode
  - on EC2
  - Amazon managed instances
  - Serverless
- Programming interface
  - SQL support
  - programming languages
- none functional features
  - scalability
  - performance
  - H.A., fault tolerant
  - consistency
  - security
- Design and Implementation
