# Types of Databases

> <p>Databases are built for a purpose and matching the use case with the database will help you write high-performance, scalable, and more functional applications faster.</p>
> <p>Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon</p>

* Relational 
  - OLTP / OLAP
* NoSql
  - Key / Value, Redis
  - Document, MongoDB
